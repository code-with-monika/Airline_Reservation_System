🛫 Airline Reservation System

📘 Overview

The Airline Reservation System is a web-based mini project designed to streamline flight management and ticket booking operations. It provides an easy-to-use interface for customers to search flights, make reservations, and view their bookings. The system also allows administrators to manage flight schedules, seat availability, and customer records through a connected MySQL database.
This project demonstrates the integration of frontend (HTML, CSS) with backend database operations (MySQL) to perform real-time airline management tasks efficiently.
